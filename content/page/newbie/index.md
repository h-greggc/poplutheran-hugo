## You Are Invited!
Join us for our traditional or contemporary worship service.Here are a few common questions newcomers might have:
#### _What time does worship begin?_
  -	The traditional service begins at 8:30 am, and the contemporary service begins at 11:00 am.
#### _What is it like?_
  -	Our traditional and contemporary services are a liturgical form of worship. The traditional service offers music that is more in line with the traditional Lutheran hymnal while the contemporary service has contemporary music lead by the Our Church Praise Band.
  -	Communion is offered at both services, and all are welcome to the Lord's table.
#### _What about my kids?_
  - We love children, and they are welcome in the sanctuary during worship. We also have a family room in back of the sanctuary where you can still hear and participate in worship.
#### _Where do I park?_
  - There is designated guest parking in front of the church, but there is parking behind the church and on the north side of the church.
#### _What do I wear?_
  -	Come as you are! Some worshippers come in shorts & t-shirts while others like to wear their Sunday best.
- What time is Sunday School?
  - Christian education classes are at 9:45 during the school year for adults, teens, and children.
#### _How can I get connected?_
